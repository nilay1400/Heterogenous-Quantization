# Reliability-Aware Performance Optimization of DNN HW Accelerators through Heterogeneous Quantization

Link to the paper:


This is the official repository for the implementation of Reliability-Aware Performance of DNN HW Accelerators through Heterogeneous Quantization. This paper introduces a framework for implementing heterogeneous quantization tailored to individual layers of DNN accelerators. The proposed method, evaluated across DNN benchmarks AlexNet, VGG-11 and ResNet-18, enhances both accuracy drop and efficiency.
